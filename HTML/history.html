<p>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. </p>
<p><img src= "first.jpg" ></p>
<p>International matches have been played since 1844 and Test cricket began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877. </p>
<P>Cricket was probably created during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across Kent and Sussex.</P>

<p>In 1744, the Laws of Cricket were codified for the first time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump and maximum bat width were added. </p>
