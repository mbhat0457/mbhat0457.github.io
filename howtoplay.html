    <p>This is how cricket is played according to the Chicago Tribune</p>
    <p>Cricket is played with two teams of 11 players each. Each team takes turns batting and bowling. The batter is a batsman and the person bowling is the bowler. The bowler tries to knock down what is known as a wicket to strike out the batsman and prevent him from scoring.</p>

    <p>Sides take turns batting and fielding. Each at-bat, called an "over," comprises no more than six bowls per batsman. </p>

    <p>The fielding team must retire or dismiss 10 batsmen to end the innings (always plural). World Cup matches are limited to one inning per team and a limit of 50 overs per inning. Non-elimination games are limited to a single day. Elimination games are allowed a second day if needed.</p>
